my personal website

i'm just using this to learn javascript. eventually it'll be my website that links to all my other things

like my medium dot com blog and anything else i care about

i'm also probably going to put projects on here or things from my talks or maybe even write up some annoying and/or colorful javascript 

IT'S JUST FOR FUN REALLY
